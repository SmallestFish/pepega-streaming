## git message formatting
In order to have clean commit messages we use conventionalcommits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
Commits that do not comply with this are going to be rejected.
For an automated set-up see: https://commitlint.js.org/#/./guides-local-setup?id=guides-local-setup
